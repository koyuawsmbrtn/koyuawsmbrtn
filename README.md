I'm Leonie and this is my GitHub profile. Other than my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/koyuawsmbrtn) profile only serious code will land here e.g. things that are mission-critical to koyu.space or I poured more time and love into rather than being some little toys.

I hope you will find something interesting here that may enrich your life.

My most notable projects are pinned on the profile. These are current working projects that are part of my portfolio.

If you want your own cool little GitHub front page on your profile just create a repository like `yourusername/yourusername`.
