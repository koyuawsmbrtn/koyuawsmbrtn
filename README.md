# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Leonie and this is my GitHub profile. Other than my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/koyuawsmbrtn) profile only serious code will land here e.g. things that are mission-critical to koyu.space or I poured more time and love into rather than being some little toys.

I hope you will find something interesting here that may enrich your life.

Btw if you want your own cool little GitHub front page on your profile just create a repository like `yourusername/yourusername`.

You can find more on my [personal website](https://web.koyu.space).
